## Basic Formulation
Put qualitatively: **oppositely charged particles attract, while similar charges repel.**

Basic form:
$$
\vec{F}_{1}=\underbrace{ \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} }_{ k }\frac{{q_{1}q_{2}}}{r^{2}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}
$$
for particle 1 ($\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ points away from particle 2 radially.)
	If $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ have the same sign, $\vec{F}$ points away from 2 (repelling).
	If they have opposite signs, $\vec{F}$ points towards 2 (attracting).

### Similarity with the Law of Gravitation
-> Coulomb's Law looks a lot like the [[Law of Gravitation]].
- $F\propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$
- Depends on product of a property of the interacting particles (mass vs. charge)
- Gravity is always attractive, unlike electrostatic force.
- Both have shell theories:
	- Charged particle outside a uniform charged shell experiences the same net force as if all charge was concentrated at the center of the shell (same for gravity).
	- Charged particle inside a uniform charged shell experiences **no** net force (as with gravity).

## Units
Units of charge are **Coulombs (C)**.
$$
1\,\mathrm{C}=(1\,\mathrm{A})(1\,\mathrm{s})
$$
1 Coulomb is equal to one Ampere-second. Amperes come from SI units.

In the formula, $k$ is usually written as $\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}=8.99\times 10^9\,\mathrm{N\cdot \frac{m^{2}}{C^{2}}}$.
$\epsilon_{0}$ is the **permittivity constant**, $8.85\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{\frac{C^{2}}{N\cdot m^{2}}}$.
