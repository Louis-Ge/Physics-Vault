Put qualitatively: **oppositely charged particles attract, while similar charges repel.**

Basic form:
$$
\vec{F}_{1}=k\frac{{q_{1}q_{2}}}{r^{2}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}
$$
for particle 1 ($\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ points away from particle 2 radially.)
	If $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ have the same sign, $\vec{F}$ points away from 2 (repelling).
	If they have opposite signs, $\vec{F}$ points towards 2 (attracting).

### Similarity with the Law of Gravitation
-> Coulomb's Law looks a lot like the [[Law of Gravitatkon]]
